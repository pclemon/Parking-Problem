# CU Parking Problems
This is open source.

### Reason for this Project
My name is Paige Clemons, and I am a student at Clemson University and the main complaint around campus is that parking is a major hassle.  A more robust version of this project was mentioned in one of my computer sience classes and the idea has stuck with me since because if students and faculty had an app to see available parking spots in all parking locations on campus, it would make our lives easier and relieve one minor stress for most on campus.

### Mission Statement
The CU Parking Problems app will be an IOS app that will allow student and faculty at Clemson University to be able to easily find available parking spots on the campus.

### Features:
* Users will be able to view parking lots.
* Users will be able to see how many total parking spots are in the lot.
* Users will be able to see how many spaces are available in the lot.
* Users will be able to mark a space as taken.
* Users will be able to unmark a space once vacant.
* USers will be able to see their location relative to park lots.

### Requirements:
* Must run on IOS 13
